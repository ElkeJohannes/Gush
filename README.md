## UX

### User stories
- As a player of the game, I want to be able to see how I should play at first glance.
- As a player of the game, I want to be able to keep track of how I did, and view my highscores.

### Strategy
The goal of this website is to provide a place for the game 'Gush' to exist. This game itself meant as both entertainment and a light exercise in memory skills, mainly aimed at my nieces and nephews but also enjoyable for adults.

### Scope
Initially the site will contain one game. The game needs only one page, as it works with dynamic content that is displayed. There will be some features to expand upon the base game, such as highscores, and invite a friend. 

### Structure
As the site will feature one page with a single game on it, there will be no need for a menu. As the game itself will be flashy and draw focus, the rest of the page will be minimalistic to keep the users focus on the game.

7. Result - succes ![Result - succes](assets/wireframes/result-succes.png)
8. Highscores ![Highscores](assets/wireframes/highscores.png)

### Surface
The website will feature soft, unobtrusive colors like off-white. This is so chosen because the shapes in the game will have strong vibrant colors to provide maximal contrast. The chosen font is Oswald. The shapes are created in MS Paint as this allows for simplistic shapes that are easily recognisable. This is important because the target audience is children.
